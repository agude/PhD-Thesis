        Fractional errors (in \%) for the absolute cross section measurement in
        different \phistar bins due to various sources. The total value is the
        sum in quadrature of all the other values. The unfolding of the data
        was done with \POWHEG. These uncertainties are also presented in
        tabular form in \TAB~\ref{tab:sys_uncert_abs_powheg}.
