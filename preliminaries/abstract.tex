% Abstract

Measurements of the \Z boson transverse momentum (\bosonpt) spectrum serves as
both a precision test of non-perturbative QCD and helps to reduce the
uncertainty in the measurement of the \W boson mass. However, \bosonpt is
limited at its lowest values by detector resolution, and so a new variable,
\phistar, which performs better in the low \bosonpt region, is used instead.
This thesis provides the first measurement the normalized differential cross
section of \Z bosons to electron pairs in terms of \phistar. The data used in
this measurement were collected by the CMS detector at the LHC and totaled
\GoodLumiNumber of integrated luminosity at \rootseight.  The results are
compared to predictions from simulation, which are found to provide a poor
description of the data.
