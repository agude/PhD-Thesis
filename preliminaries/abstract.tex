% Abstract

Measurements of the \Z boson transverse momentum (\bosonpt) spectrum serve as
both precision tests of non-perturbative QCD and help to reduce the uncertainty
in the measurement of the \W boson mass. However, \bosonpt is
limited at its lowest values by detector resolution, and so a new variable,
\phistar, which performs better in the low \bosonpt region, is used instead.
This thesis presents the first measurement of the normalized differential cross
section of \Z bosons decaying to electron pairs in terms of \phistar at
\rootseight. The data used in this measurement were collected by the CMS
detector at the LHC in 2012 and totaled \GoodLumiNumber of integrated
luminosity. The results are compared to predictions from simulation, which are
found to provide a poor description of the data.
